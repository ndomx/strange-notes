# strange-notes
Alterate the amount of notes there are in the musical scale.

Why does the musical scale has exactly 12 notes? (A, B, C, D, E, F, G + #s)
Play with custom scales and listen to different ways to divide an octave.

## Usage
### MATLAB
Just run `custom_note_scale.m` on MATLAB and change the number of notes inside the code.

### Python3
Be sure to install all dependencies first
~~~bash
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install matplotlib
pip3 install sounddevice
~~~
And run `python3 custom_note_scale.py N` where _N_ is the number of notes in the custom scale.
